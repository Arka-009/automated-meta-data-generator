## 🚀 Features
- Upload support for `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt`
- Text extraction from documents
- Semantic metadata generation using NLP:
  - Summary
  - Top keywords
  - Word count
- Download metadata as JSON
- Simple and clean web interface using Streamlit

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit (for UI)
- PyMuPDF (for PDF text extraction)
- python-docx (for DOCX files)
- pytesseract, textract (for OCR/text extraction)
- spaCy + KeyBERT (for NLP/keywords/summary)
