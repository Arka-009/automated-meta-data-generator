#  Automated Metadata Generation System

This project is a web-based application that automatically extracts and generates metadata from uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT). It enhances document discoverability by summarizing content and identifying keywords using NLP techniques.

## üöÄ Features
- Upload support for `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt`
- Text extraction from documents
- Semantic metadata generation using NLP:
  - Summary
  - Top keywords
  - Word count
- Download metadata as JSON
- Simple and clean web interface using Streamlit

## üõ† Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit (for UI)
- PyMuPDF (for PDF text extraction)
- python-docx (for DOCX files)
- pytesseract, textract (for OCR/text extraction)
- spaCy + KeyBERT (for NLP/keywords/summary)

## üß™ How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-metadata-generator.git
cd automated-metadata-generator
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)

## üì¶ Output Example
```json
{
  "word_count": 241,
  "summary": "This is an example summary of the first few sentences.",
  "keywords": ["metadata", "document", "semantic"]
}
```
